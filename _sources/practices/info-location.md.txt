# Where information is located

## General organizational information / documents / brainstorms

We also have some organizational documents in a shared Google folder called "2i2c". Your 2i2c address will give you access to this folder (or if you do not have access, please request it!):

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOC1AuqvQOcAlHAYkHsjbSbLQdkseujO?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOC1AuqvQOcAlHAYkHsjbSbLQdkseujO?usp=sharing)

The folder is organized into a few top-level folders that *should* be relatively self-explanatory, but don't hesitate to ask for a quick guide.

## Todos, project plans and management

2i2c uses [the Projects page](../reference/projects.md) to keep track of the major projects that it is working on. That page has links to the location of project-specific to-do lists, deliverables, etc.

More organization-specific discussion and items we track can also be found in [the private 2i2c `meta` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta).

Generally speaking the daily specifics of activity on a project are recorded *outside* of the team compass, as they are more dynamic. The important thing is that the team compass make it clear *where* to find this information, and that the information is kept up-to-date for all.


## Tips for working remotely

2i2c is a remote-first organization, and believes strongly in following practices that are inclusive, participatory, and collaborative. It has team members spread out over many time zones working on a variety of projects. There are many guides and tips for working remotely[^remote-work1], and we've tried to distill a few key components for our workflows:

1. **Have a single source of truth**. For any information or projects in 2i2c, there should be one source of truth. Any conflicting information will defer to this source of truth, and it should be updated first and often. The default source of truth is this team compass, unless otherwise specified.

2. **Document everything**. Documentation is the most important tool for coordinating and distributing information across remote teams. It is crucial that 2i2c team members document all relevant information about their projects, what they are working on, etc.

3. **Broadcast updates in multiple places**. Different people have different preferred methods of engagement and communication on 2i2c projects. For this reason, don't assume that posting an update or question in a single location will reach everybody that you wish to reach. Do not hesitate to post questions or ask for feedback in multiple places (e.g., GitHub, Slack, or even email). However, try to keep information in a single place to have a single source of truth.

4. **Update often**. Err on the side of updating the team more often than not.  Nobody should be surprised when something gets done - especially nothing major. Your work should be as transparent to others as possible!


## Marketing and communication

There are three main ways that 2i2c communicates with the outside world:

- Twitter: [@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)
  - Currently, there is nobody activately monitoring the Twitter account. We use it to post links to blog posts or major announcements in the newsletter.
- Newsletter: [using Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
  - Users sign up to the newsletter via our landing page's contact form at [2i2c.org#contact](https://2i2c.org#contact). Email addresses are imported into Mailchimp for the newsletter.
- Blog: [2i2c.org/blog]
  - The blog is managed by our [Hugo website repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/2i2c.github.io). All new posts are automatically sent to the mailing list on a weekly basis.

## Slack

### Who is invited to the Slack?

Currently, anyone who is interested can join the 2i2c Slack. Initially this is people that mentioned they would like to join via our blog post. Any Slack member is welcome to send an invite link to another person that would like to join.

### Private vs. Public rooms in the Slack

There are a mix of private and public rooms in the Slack. In general, conversations about projects, development, etc should be in public rooms. **Most conversation in the 2i2c Slack should be in public channels**.

We'll create private rooms for a few specific topics that probably warrant private conversation. By default, we'll start with:

- `#partnerships` - to discuss new partnerships with 2i2c
- `#recruiting` - to discuss hiring with 2i2c

and eventually

- `#sales` - to discuss new sales leads etc

Conversation about more sensitive topics like *pursuing* collaborations, sales, etc should be in a private room until it's appropriate to start discussing in public channels. By default, all 2i2c staff, key volunteers, and founders will have access to all private rooms (it is only the "friends of 2i2c" and users that do not have access).

### Code of Conduct

2i2c is still in the process of creating its Code of Conduct, so it does not have a 2i2c-specific CoC to apply to the Slack. In the meantime, all members of the 2i2c Slack must abide by the [NumFocus Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) guidelines. If you wish to report a violation of this code of conduct in the 2i2c Slack, send an email to [`conduct@2i2c.org`](mailto:conduct@2i2c.org).

```{warning}
This section will be updated once 2i2c defines its own CoC and reporting infrastructure.
```

### What rooms to use?

We try to keep the number of rooms to a minimum, and only add new rooms if it really feels necessary (e.g. if we keep having "off topic" conversations about the same topic in one room). Over time, we can revisit the Slack rooms that we use, and add / prune as needed.

### Bots

We use the [GitHub bots](https://slack.github.com/) to track github issues that are relevant to Slack channels, and explore more integrations in the future. In general we should only use the bot to mirror comments if a repository is *obviously always relevant* to a channel. Otherwise, only mirror comments that are *tagged with a particular label* (e.g. `#recruiting`).
