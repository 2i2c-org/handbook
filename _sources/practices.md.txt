# Team practices

## The 2i2c handbook

The primary {term}`source of truth <Single Source of Truth>` for information about 2i2c and its teams is the [2i2c Handbook](https://2i2c.org/handbook). This contains information for new and current 2i2c team members, as well as the latest information about the status of various projects (or pointers to where you should look).

## General organizational information / documents / brainstorms

We also have some organizational documents in a shared Google folder called "2i2c". Your 2i2c address will give you access to this folder (or if you do not have access, please request it!):

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOC1AuqvQOcAlHAYkHsjbSbLQdkseujO?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOC1AuqvQOcAlHAYkHsjbSbLQdkseujO?usp=sharing)

The folder is organized into a few top-level folders that *should* be relatively self-explanatory, but don't hesitate to ask for a quick guide.

## Todos, project plans and management

2i2c uses [the Handbook Projects page](projects.md) to keep track of the major projects that it is working on. That page has links to the location of project-specific to-do lists, deliverables, etc.

More organization-specific discussion and items we track can also be found in [the private 2i2c `meta` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta).

Generally speaking the daily specifics of activity on a project are recorded *outside* of the handbook, as they are more dynamic. The important thing is that the handbook make it clear *where* to find this information, and that the information is kept up-to-date for all.

## Team Conversation

### Formal and project communication

2i2c uses GitHub issues and pull-requests to track more *formal* communication on projects and discussions. These issues are generally used as the {term}`Single Source of Truth` for most of our projects. When in doubt, create an issue so that we can track its progress. Check the repositories in [the `2i2c-org` GitHub org](https://github.com/2i2c-org) for where these conversations happen.

In general, you are expected to monitor repositories that are important to the work that you're doing. Keep up-to-date with new issues and comments on pre-existing issues. These are the official record of "things happening" in 2i2c.

### Informal communication

Informal communication happens in the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)). This Slack has both 2i2c staff and founding team members, as well as several other interested parties. You should now have access to the 2i2c Slack. If not, send one of the team members an email.

All information with 2i2c must have a {term}`Single Source of Truth`. Since information is fairly difficult to archive and discover on Slack, we *do not* treat it as a source of truth. Use it for coordination and communication, but make sure that any important information is documented elsewhere.

Here are things that **should not** be in Slack, but instead put in an issue or other Source of Truth location:

- Important updates on the status of a project or issue
- Decisions that were made from conversations in Slack
- Important dates or deadlines announced on Slack
- Major bugs or problems that were unconvered on Slack
- New ideas that warrant follow-up

You are *encouraged* but not *required* to take part in conversation on Slack.


## Tips for working remotely

2i2c is a remote-first organization, and believes strongly in following practices that are inclusive, participatory, and collaborative. It has team members spread out over many time zones working on a variety of projects. There are many guides and tips for working remotely[^remote-work1], and we've tried to distill a few key components for our workflows:

1. **Have a single source of truth**. For any information or projects in 2i2c, there should be one source of truth. Any conflicting information will defer to this source of truth, and it should be updated first and often. The default source of truth is this handbook, unless otherwise specified.

2. **Document everything**. Documentation is the most important tool for coordinating and distributing information across remote teams. It is crucial that 2i2c team members document all relevant information about their projects, what they are working on, etc.

3. **Broadcast updates in multiple places**. Different people have different preferred methods of engagement and communication on 2i2c projects. For this reason, don't assume that posting an update or question in a single location will reach everybody that you wish to reach. Do not hesitate to post questions or ask for feedback in multiple places (e.g., GitHub, Slack, or even email). However, try to keep information in a single place to have a single source of truth.

4. **Update often**. Err on the side of updating the team more often than not.  Nobody should be surprised when something gets done - especially nothing major. Your work should be as transparent to others as possible!


## Marketing and communication

There are three main ways that 2i2c communicates with the outside world:

- Twitter: [@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)
  - Currently, there is nobody activately monitoring the Twitter account. We use it to post links to blog posts or major announcements in the newsletter.
- Newsletter: [using Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
  - Users sign up to the newsletter via our landing page's contact form at [2i2c.org#contact](https://2i2c.org#contact). Email addresses are imported into Mailchimp for the newsletter.
- Blog: [2i2c.org/blog]
  - The blog is managed by our [Hugo website repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/2i2c.github.io). All new posts are automatically sent to the mailing list on a weekly basis.


## Terminology

Here are some helpful terms that we use at 2i2c.

```{glossary}
Single Source of Truth
  Remote teams and open communities need to balance information across team members, and ensure that everyone is on the same page. For this reason, it is recommended to adopt a "single source of truth" for anything important [^sst1]. This is an authoritative source that everyone can look to in order to know the current status and plan for anything we do at 2i2c.
```
