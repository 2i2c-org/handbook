# Tech team coordination process

As a totally distributed team, it is important to have team practices that give one another insight into what we're working on, identify opportunities to collaborate, and un-block one another. This page describes some of the practices that we adopt towards these goals.

## Our goals

Here are the goals we optimize for in organizing our team coordination practices.

- Give team members insight into what one another is working on (not to "report up")
- Look for opportunities to work together and/or support one another's work efficiently
- Provide some social accountability to get stuff done

We want to do this with high efficiency so that people can quickly get on the same page and focus efforts around decision-making and collaboration. We also wish to do it in a ðŸ’¯ remote-friendly way since we are split across many different time-zones.

## Defining our active projects and to-do items

**Active projects list**: The 2i2c team compass has [a projects page](https://2i2c.org/team-compass/projects/) that has details about major projects that we run at 2i2c. We use this as {term}`Source of Truth` for the major projects that we are working on, and this can be a combination of development-focused things and higher-level project-focused things. These projects should contain links to the location that daily "project management" and goal-setting are happening.

**Per-project to-dos and conversation**: Generally speaking specific projects will have their own place for team conversation, to-do items, and strategy. This is generally *not* in the 2i2c team compass, but there should always be links and references in the team compass that points somebody in the right direction.

**Discussion around team practices**: For discussion around strategy that doesn't have a natural place elsewhere, we use `team-compass` issues and PRs. If an issue, it should be actionable (and "closeable"), generally in a way that results in a change to the team compass. If a PR, it should be a proposal to change the team compass and thus update some strategic information in there.

## Bi-weekly team syncs

By-weekly team syncs happen **every other Monday**. They are a way to synchronize our team goals and practices. Here's how to conduct a team sync.

1. **Create an issue in the [`team-compass`](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass)**. This is where we'll keep track of the "to-do" for the team sync.
2. **Clean up [the HackMD](https://hackmd.io/i2Siurp1TkmPYgn3ZgxFQw?both) for the sync**. We'll use [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/i2Siurp1TkmPYgn3ZgxFQw?both) to run the team sync. At the top is a set of questions to answer, and we can We'll initially use the HackMD to give responses. You can create it from the following template:
3. **Team members give their responses**. You can copy/paste the template, and then give your responses below. You shouldn't feel forced to add content if you can't think of anything, use it as much as is useful. 
4. **We'll leave the HackMD open for 48hrs**, not counting weekends or holidays. That should give enough time for those of us across many time zones to respond.
5. **Merge into the [dev team sync notes](team/meetings/index.md)**. This is where we'll store our sync notes for each team sync, and refer to them later.

## What about stuff that shouldn't be public?

For technical and infrastructure development, we should default to public. However, if something should *not* be public, mark it as-such in the HackMD and it won't be included in the public notes.

## Inspiration

This is a similar process as the one followed in the **jupyterhub `team-compass`**. It also follows a similar model to how [`gitlab` uses their handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/).
