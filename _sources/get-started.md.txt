# Getting started at 2i2c

This is a guide and checklist for new team members of 2i2c to get oriented, and to make sure that you're set up with all the resources you need to start contributing!

## Checklist

First and foremost, these are the things that should be completed to consider a new person "onboarded". When a new team member joins,

```md

```

## Accounts

### Your 2i2c email address

Someone should have sent you a message with your 2i2c email address. You can use this to access information in the 2i2c drive, as well as various online services that we use such as cloud engines. You can sign in to your email address at gmail.com (it behaves like a Google account).

### Google Drive

Your 2i2c email address will get you access to a Google Drive that contains documents, brainstorms, and other assets that aren't fit for the 2i2c Handbook. You can log into the Google Drive by going to `drive.google.com` and adding a new account using your `@2i2c.org` address and password.

### GitHub Access

2i2c has a few GitHub repositories. You should have membership in the `2i2c-org` GitHub organization and write access to its repositories. Check that this is the case and, if not, ask for access in the Slack.


### NameCheap Access

2i2c runs much of its cloud infrastructure at custom URLs created for the target institution. In order to ensure you have the ability to create new URLs, you should have access to the 2i2c NameCheap account. If not, ask for access in the Slack.


### Cloud Accounts

2i2c has a number of cloud accounts that it uses to create and operate its infrastructure. You should have access to the cloud accounts for any projects that you expect to work on. This includes Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services. The specific project might depend on what youâ€™re working on, so check with the team to make sure you have the right access.


## Team information

### The 2i2c handbook

The primary "source of truth" for information about 2i2c and its teams is the [2i2c Handbook](https://2i2c.org/handbook). This contains information for new and current 2i2c team members, as well as the latest information about the status of various projects (or pointers to where you should look).


### General organizational information / documents / brainstorms

We also have some organizational documents in a shared Google folder called "2i2c". Your 2i2c address will give you access to this folder (or if you do not have access, please request it!):

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOC1AuqvQOcAlHAYkHsjbSbLQdkseujO?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOC1AuqvQOcAlHAYkHsjbSbLQdkseujO?usp=sharing)

The folder is organized into a few top-level folders that *should* be relatively self-explanatory, but don't hesitate to ask for a quick guide.


### Todos, project plans and management

2i2c uses [the Handbook Projects page](projects.md) to keep track of the major projects that it is working on. That page has links to the location of project-specific to-do lists, deliverables, etc.

### Team Conversation

Most 2i2c communication happens in the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)). This Slack has both founding team members and several other interested parties in 2i2c. You should now have access to the 2i2c Slack. If not, send one of the team members an email.

There is also some communication that will happen on the GitHub repositories we work on, most likely for technical and infrastructure items.


## What projects is 2i2c working on?

## Tips for working remotely

2i2c is a remote-first organization, and believes strongly in following practices that are inclusive, participatory, and collaborative. It has team members spread out over many time zones working on a variety of projects. As such, it follows a few best-practices to ensure this works well:

1. **Have a single source of truth**. For any information or projects in 2i2c, there should be one source of truth. Any conflicting information will defer to this source of truth, and it should be updated first and often. The default source of truth is this handbook, unless otherwise specified.

2. **Document everything**. Documentation is the most important tool for coordinating and distributing information across remote teams. It is crucial that 2i2c team members document all relevant information about their projects, what they are working on, etc.

3. **Broadcast updates in multiple places**. Different people have different preferred methods of engagement and communication on 2i2c projects. For this reason, don't assume that posting an update or question in a single location will reach everybody that you wish to reach. Do not hesitate to post questions or ask for feedback in multiple places (e.g., GitHub, Slack, or even email). However, try to keep information in a single place to have a single source of truth.

4. **Update often**. Err on the side of updating the team more often than not.  Nobody should be surprised when something gets done - especially nothing major. Your work should be as transparent to others as possible!
