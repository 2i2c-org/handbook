## Accounts

### Your 2i2c email address

Someone should have sent you a message with your 2i2c email address. You can use this to access information in the 2i2c drive, as well as various online services that we use such as cloud engines. You can sign in to your email address at gmail.com (it behaves like a Google account).

### Google Drive

Your 2i2c email address will get you access to a Google Drive that contains documents, brainstorms, and other assets that aren't fit for the 2i2c Team Compass. You can log into the Google Drive by going to `drive.google.com` and adding a new account using your `@2i2c.org` address and password.

### GitHub Access

2i2c has a few GitHub repositories. You should have membership in the `2i2c-org` GitHub organization and write access to its repositories. Check that this is the case and, if not, ask for access in the Slack.


### NameCheap Access

2i2c runs much of its cloud infrastructure at custom URLs created for the target institution. In order to ensure you have the ability to create new URLs, you should have access to the 2i2c NameCheap account. If not, ask for access in the Slack.


### Cloud Accounts

2i2c has a number of cloud accounts that it uses to create and operate its infrastructure. You should have access to the cloud accounts for any projects that you expect to work on. This includes Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services. The specific project might depend on what youâ€™re working on, so check with the team to make sure you have the right access.
