# Pricing strategy

Currently, we are pricing 2i2c Managed Hub Services in a bespoke fashion, according to the needs and budget of each group that we work with.
Over time, we plan on standardizing prices for various kinds of hubs (or at least standardizing the pricing process).

Our pricing approach and strategy is currently documented [in the Managed Service Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ka7tgJe7HR8EmS_MMakrYztgfkJT_iFksPsWHdQBqhM/edit#heading=h.psalop1qciz3).
