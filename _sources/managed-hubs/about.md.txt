# The Managed JupyterHub Service

The Managed JupyterHub Service is a special project that is run by 2i2c.
It is an ongoing service, and thus is less development-oriented than projects that are funded by grants and collaborations.

The key goal of the 2i2c Managed JupyterHub Service is to launch a self-sustaining service that provides managed JupyterHub distributions to customers in research and education.

We are currently in the pilot phase of this project, with the goal of creating a basic shared infrastructure that can deploy, configure, and manage many JupyterHub distributions.
We are also building a sales and support pipeline around this infrasturcture.

## Where is information located?

**Infrastructure and development** happens in [the `pilot-hubs/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs).
This is both the deployment infrastructure for the 2i2c JupyterHubs, as well as documentation and team coordination around developing and running them.

**Running JupyterHubs** are tracked as issues in the `pilot-hubs/` repository.
When a new hub is created, [create a new GitHub issue for the hub](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/issues/new) using the "New Hub" template.
This issue is a "meta" issue that tracks the state of this hub over time.
These issues serve both as a "Source of Truth" of information about the hub, as well as a place for conversation around operating that hub.

**User Documentation** is located in [the `pilot/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot). This contains user-facing information about the Pilot Hubs, such as how they can add/remove users, update their environment, get support, etc.
