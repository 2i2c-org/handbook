# 2i2c strategy and goals

This page describes some of the high-level goals and strategy that 2i2c is currently pursuing. These generally span multiple projects as well as several months.

## Strategic plan

The 2i2c strategic plan is a combination of active and aspirational priorities that help us get closer to achieving our organizational mission. These are roughly broken down into **Objectives and Key Results** across four categories, associated with the [mission of 2i2c](https://2i2c.org/#what-we-do):

- [Interactive Computing in Research](strategy:research)
- [Supporting Interactive Computing in Education](strategy:education)
- [Supporting Open Source Communities for Interactive Computing](strategy:open-source)
- [Organizational and operational goals](strategy:organizational)

Each [2i2c project](projects.md) should work towards accomplishing one or more of these goals. Note that there are no deadlines yet associated with these goals, as 2i2c is still in the process of defining its organizational structure and cadence.

(strategy:research)=
### Interactive computing in research

* Support the Pangeo project
  * 2i2c team members regularly contribute to Pangeo core infrastructure
  * Pangeo community members report stability and general positive experiences running Pangeo infrastructure
* Extend Pan-foo computing models to new communities
  * Adapt Pangeo infrastructure and deployments for at least 2 new research communities
  * Pangeo-specific patterns and infrastructure are generalized to be domain-agnostic
  * Documentation for reccomendations using 2i2c Hub infrastructure for Pan-foo projects
* Sustaining research hub infrastructure
  * A hub and sustainability model is developed for supporting new research communities with Pangeo-like needs

(strategy:education)=
### Interactive computing in education

* Support for large institutional hub infrastructure
  * Run at least 2 pilots for institutions with a heterogeneous user base (AKA, not for a specific project)
  * Identify development opportunities to improve the use of hubs for large and diverse educational users (e.g., multiple courses, departments, etc)
  * Conversion from pilot hubs to paid hubs for 2-3 large institutions

* Support for smaller / lesser-resourced institutions
  * Hubs for All that is sustainable and scalable
  * Pilot hubs for several of these kinds of organizations
  * Conversion from pilot hubs to paid hubs for 5-10 smaller institutions

* Improving technology for education with JupyterHub
  * Development towards LMS integration (e.g. OpenEdX, Canvas, etc)
  * Grading infrastructure or guidelines
  * Recommended documentation for educational use cases on 2i2c Hubs

* Sustaining educational hubs
  * Sustainability model for large institutional hubs
  * Sustainability model for smaller or under-resourced institutions

(strategy:open-source)=
### Supporting open source communities

* 2i2c team guidelines for supporting open source
  * Identify major open source tools we direct 2i2c resources towards
  * Create an "Open source support" plan to highlight these projects and our contributions
  * Create a 2i2c policy for upstreaming and supporting open source communities (e.g. % time spent, reporting back OS contribs, etc)
* Core support for key OS tools
  * Documented contributions across all 2i2c engineers for key OS projects.
  * Commits, contributions in issues/PRs, community work, major development efforts, etc

(strategy:organizational)=
### Organizational

* Lay an organizational foundation
  * Document organizational practices and key information
  * External-facing materials, website, etc
  * Staff early projects

* Define team and organization processes
  * Communications processes
  * Project management and documentation processes
  * Strategic prioritization processes

* Sustainability for 2i2c staff
  * At least 2 years of funding for leadership and an engineering team
  * Sustainability and growth models for hub offerings

* Grow partnerships with key organizations
  * Cloud providers
  * Non-profits to collaborate with
  * Funding institutions that may be interested in support 2i2c projects
  * Key research or education institutions
