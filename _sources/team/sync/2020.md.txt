#### Thanks I'd like to give ðŸ™Œ
- Yuvi has helped me a bunch in figuring out technical scope of work / needs for a few collaborator proposals. Thanks Yuvi!

 
#### Updates from last two weeks âœ” 
- Most of my time these last few weeks has been spent on organizational stuff (see the `#org-updates` channel in the Slack for some updates there)
- I've been attending the Jupyter Meets the Earth bi-weekly meetings, and will help advise on documentation and using Jupyter Book
- We've also been in touch with the education team at Berkeley to work out a system of collaboration for community colleges that are using the educational hubs. Going to meet early next year to get things started.

#### What I'm up to next â¬œ
- Finishing up some proposals for collaborations with other geoscience use-cases in 2i2c
- Finding some opportunities to align development between the JMTE grant and 2i2c
