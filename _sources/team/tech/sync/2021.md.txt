#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Thanks to Yuvi and Georgiana for giving feedback on the team process issue around goals!

#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- I have mostly been working with ICSI to define the contract that we'll use

- Doing a bit of biz-dev trying to refine the [Managed Service Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ka7tgJe7HR8EmS_MMakrYztgfkJT_iFksPsWHdQBqhM/edit?usp=sharing) that we're offering to people.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Beyond finalizing those two issues, I'm going to work with Yuvi a bit to improve our documentation for the 2i2c Hubs!

### Erik Sundell

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Thanks Yuvi for your encouraging spirit (love bombing twitter)!
- Thanks Chris for your attentive leadership (clear and quick responses)!

#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- I have taken some time off.
- I have done a bit more review work than usual and less development efforts of my own.
    - Z2JH feature `prePuller.hook.pullOnlyOnChanges` is now available though btw
- I have helped Ariel with an AWS deployment

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Z2JH security vulnerability in z2jh guide on how to setup a AWS EKS cluster to be corrected and communicated.

### Chris Holdgraf

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Cathryn and Jim have both been very helpful in helping me think through some high-level strategic questions about 2i2c!
- Ryan Abernathy and Georgiana both helped interview our job candidates, and their feedback was invaluable!
 
#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- The last two weeks have all been about doing diligence on our applicants, and working with ICSI to understand how we can open up our first sales with them.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- The work with ICSI is ongoing, but I think that we are getting closer. I've got a draft of a contract that they're sending to a lawyer soon, and then we should be able to start accepting money for running hubs.
- In addition, I hope to hear back from the two job candidates in the next few weeks about their decision!

### Erik Sundell

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- I'm thankful for all 2i2c members for their efforts into building this org! :heart:
- I'm thankful for Yuvi's positive and uplifting comments and help reviewing various PRs! :heart:
 
#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- I've done a little bit of this and a little bit of that across the JupyterHub org (Example [general maintenance PR](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-idle-culler/pull/20)), but I'm currently most excited about [this pr](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/2033). It is finally getting the z2jh configuration reference updated to fully cover the available config options and at the same time including a jsonschema file that `helm` can use to catch various config errors for users of the chart and provide sensible messages while doing so.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Pushing onwards to z2jh 1.0.0, after the schema validation logic I want to acquire an "official status" on artifacthub.io where it is listed and make do a pass at the z2jh documentation so it is updated with lessons learned across time.

#### Links to items for discussion 💬
- @yuvipanda I've love to hear your suggestions on pod resource requests or empirical data on pod resource consumption as you hint you could share! To me, that would be one of those nice 1.0.0 features we can ship with the documentation.
  
  I'd be very happy to format and writeup the documentation and such based on a more raw knowledge input btw.

### Georgiana Dolocan

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- To Chris for giving me the opportunity to participate in the interview process, it was a great learning oportunity
- To Yuvi for explaining every technical concept so well.
- To Erik for all the work in z2jh and making jupyter-server-proxy fully compatible with JupyterLab3
 
#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- These past weeks, I've worked on setting a new hub for the Mills College, upgrading the hub version in pilot-hubs as part of the process. I also tried to make the hub health checks more robust and investigated the use JupyterLab3 with the pilot-hubs.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- TLJH needs some <3, so I'll try to get it a bit more up to date
- Investigate if our current Auth0 setup can support multiple hub authentication methods

### Erik Sundell

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Min put in a lot of effort to help me review PRs and it made me very happy!
- Yuvi pinged me about technical inspiration (database class where each user has a dedicated database available). It is inspiring, I'm excited about the possibilities that open up in educational settings by removing various technical barriers to get started without getting stuck in hardware setup / software installation / licenses etc.
 
#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- I've worked on z2jh PRs towards 1.0.0, where the following updates can be relevant to know about:
    - [hub.extraFiles / singleuser.extraFiles](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/2006)
      This feature can help 2i2c deployments by offloading you off the logic to do define volumes/volumeMounts and helping YAML/JSON/TOML file to be mounted be configured from multiple helm configuration files (config.yaml / secret.yaml). It is also possible to have standalone files but then you must use --set-file during `helm upgrade` which is a bit messier.
    - [seed secrets](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/1993) + [followup fix](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/2016)
      This feature makes us no longer need to set or pass proxy.secretToken, hub.cookieSecret, or auth.state.cryptoKey - they will be automatically generated if not explicitly set.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Pushing onwards towards z2jh 1.0.0
- Write a paper with Ariel Rokem for PEARC about neurohackademy

#### Links to items for discussion 💬
- I'd love help to get the [extraFiles](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/2006) PR towards merge.
    - Thank you Chris and Yuvi for your previous review!! Your previous review points have been addressed now!
- I'd also appreciate a of the seed secrets [followup fix](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/2016).
- I'm generally curious about developing a solution to providing a authentication proxy for JupyterHub's services, communicating with JupyterHub as an identity provider and relying on JupyterHub group membership something to decide if the user should be granted network access to the service - such as /services/docs for example. I'm not sure yet how to go about it, but I think it would be one of those somewhat general purpose tools and those motivate me a lot to work on!

### Yuvi

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- To Georgiana for:
    - Taking full responsibility for working with Aaron Culich on the Mills hub
    - Writing full fledged health checks for hubs, so we have more confidence that they actually work
    - Fixing bugs with the UToronto hub as they get reported
- To chris, georgiana and ryan for helping run intterviews
- To chris for organizing everything so we don't all drown

### Chris Holdgraf

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Thanks to Yuvi for giving Georgiana so much guidance on the Toronto hub!
 
#### Updates from last two weeks ✔ 
- Dealing with 100% parenting + 100% working (fun!)
- Working on moving forward some more contracts for 2i2c (see https://github.com/2i2c-org/leads/projects/1)
- Refactoring some of our team process / communication / workflow
- Setting up hiring practices that we can use for the OSIE hire + future ones!

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Figuring out our budget situation for the next 2 years
- Finding a way to spend my Jupyter Book grant!
- Thinking more about prices + features + products strategy
- Hiring somebody!


## 2021-01-05

### Erik

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Thank you everyone for connecting and establishing collaborations between 2i2c and so many amazing groups of people! I'm excited about 2i2c helping them!
- Thanks Yuvi for addressing the challenge of standardizing [Grafana Dashboards for z2jh deployments](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/announce-grafana-dashboards-for-jupyterhub-on-kubernetes/7320)!
- I'm very thankful for @manics work, most recently for creating and working with me on the [jupyterhub/action-k3s-helm](https://github.com/jupyterhub/action-k3s-helm) GitHub action we now reuse for four or more JupyterHub projects.

#### Updates from last two weeks ✔
- I've worked generally motivated by making JupyterHub repositories maintenance more sustainable by reducing complexity, improving CI, improving docs, and pushing for a 1.0.0 release of z2jh.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Z2JH 0.11.0 release.
- Z2JH 1.0.0 features relying on Helm 3 to reduce complexity such as needing to manage proxy.secretToken etc.

#### Links to items for discussion 💬
- Merging [this Z2JH PR](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/1943) is what remains for the 0.11.0 release. I have looked for help to review it but the JupyterHub team membars are generally low on capacity. I'm not happy about either of the options I see: to wait, to self merge, or to repeat requests for help.

  Any ideas on how to manage this general situation and this specific PR is greatly appreciated. In general I currently wish for the JupyterHub team to compromise a bit on review stringency during times when reviewer's availability are low. It would be nice to have some guidelines.
- Meta discussion: Did I use this team-sync somewhat as intended? Any suggestions for changes in any form?

### Geo

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Many thanks to Yuvi for being a great mentor and for all the time and effort put in getting me familiar with the 2i2c projects and technology.
- Thanks for Chris' great work in growing 2i2c and for the great oboarding process created.

#### Updates from last two weeks ✔
- These past weeks, I spent most of the time working on getting familiar with the 2i2c pilot-hubs, fixing a couple of issues and reviewing a few PRs as part of the process.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Supporting Yuvi in getting the UToronto hub ready for the winter semester.
- Developing tests to check and ensure the pilot-hubs' health.

### Chris

#### Thanks I'd like to give 🙌
- Thanks to Erik and Geo for joining the first team (a)sync :-)

#### Updates from last two weeks ✔
- We've just submitted two NSF sub-awards, one for a satellite mission at Texas Tech (well, this one was a pre-award), and another for a collaboration with UW and others around collaborative cloud science!
- This has also involved a lot of discussion with ICSI about how to manage these collaborations etc.
- I have eaten a lot of 🧀 and drank a lot of 🍷 with my French family.

#### What I'm up to next ⬜
- Wrapping up the next few collaboration proposals
- Starting the hiring process for the open OSIE position
- Updating our team compass docs with things we've learned after the last few proposals we've written
- More about hub pricing and "products" that we offer

#### Links to items for discussion 💬
- Just a general one - check out the team compass! https://2i2c.org/team-compass and please don't hesitate to contribute anything to this that you think would be useful.
