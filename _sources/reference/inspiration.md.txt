# Inspiration for 2i2c's practices

## The Team Compass

This team-compass is inspired by the team compass repositories used across the Jupyter ecosystem. For example:

- [The JupyterHub team compass](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/)
- [The JupyterLab team compass](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass)

In addition, it is inspired by several open company handbooks from companies and organizations dedicated to transparency. In particular:

- [The GitLab Company handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/)
- [The Basecamp Company handbook](https://basecamp.com/handbook)
- [The Valve company handbook](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)


## Organizational influences

These are organizations that have influenced the structure and practices of 2i2c (both as organizations to emulate, as well as avoid emulating).


### Organizational structure / culture

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) - is a large open-core company that is innovative in its remote- and async-friendly organization as well as its transparency.
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/handbook) - is a remote-only company that has been successful for many years. They also publish much of their company culture/practices online.


### Open core / SaaS inspiration

Interesting SaaS with an open-core offering.

- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) - offers an open source hosted community forum application. They do a good job of walking the line between community values and sustainability (e.g., see [the discourse about page](https://www.discourse.org/about)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - creator of the popular RStudio IDE for the R programming language. RStudio is a B-corporation that does an excellent job of cultivating an open and inclusive community around its products and open source ecosystem.

For-profit companies with interesting histories that we should avoid becoming.

- [Wikia / Fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)) - similar to the Wikimedia Foundation but a for-profit company offering wiki hosting that is ad supported / paid.
- [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit) - used to be open source code / infrastructure before it was acquired by Conde Nast!


### Academia-focused companies/non-profits

- [Ithaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaka_Harbors) - is a non-profit organizations that provides scholarly services for the academic community.
- [Internet2](https://internet2.edu/) - provides a variety of infrastructure and technical services to the academic community.
  Their technical expertise has shifted over the years but they've done a great job of remaining relevant and useful partners.

## Documentation

Here are a few excellent guides for writing good documentation:

- [The Divio documentation framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/structure.html)
- [GitLab's documentation structure](https://documentation.divio.com/)
