# Active Projects at 2i2c

:::{note}
You can also find a list of projects [on the 2i2c website](https://2i2c.org/projects/),
but this page is the source of truth.
:::

Projects are focused work that 2i2c conducts over a long-ish period of time.
Each project has the following things:

1. A name / description
2. A key goal
3. Project board (where is the high-level view of the project?)
4. Project information (where to find meeting notes, discussion, etc)

Below is a list of active projects for 2i2c.
