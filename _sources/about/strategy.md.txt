# Strategy and goals

The 2i2c strategic plan is a combination of active and aspirational priorities that help us get closer to achieving our organizational mission. These are broken down into **strategic goals and objects for each**, with links to projects that feed into these objectives. There are four categories, associated with the [mission of 2i2c](https://2i2c.org/#what-we-do):

- {badge}`research,badge-primary`: Interactive Computing in Research
- {badge}`education, badge-secondary`: Supporting Interactive Computing in Education
- {badge}`open-source, badge-info`: Supporting Open Source Communities for Interactive Computing
- {badge}`organization, badge-success`: Organizational and operational goals

Each [2i2c project](../reference/projects.md) should work towards accomplishing one or more of these goals. Note that there are no deadlines yet associated with these goals, as 2i2c is still in the process of defining its organizational structure and cadence.


## Build an organizational and business model

A core offering of 2i2c is to act as a **service provider** and **development partner** for hire. This means that we need to define business objectives, pricing and growth models, and products that are useful and sustainable for both 2i2c and our potential customers.


## Support the pan-foo model for research and extend the Pangeo project

The Pangeo Project is a core partner of 2i2c, and one of our strategic goals is to build on its success in other research fields. We aim to learn more about the infrastructure deployments for Pangeo in order to understand how to diversify and scale its model sustainably.


## Support educational hubs for large and small institutions

We'll need to be able to deploy hub infrastructure that meets the needs of many kinds of institutions, and our first steps will be to deploy hub pilots for them. This will help us prototype technology and learn more about their use-cases. Ultimately it will lead to us being able to sustainably serve these communities with hub infrastructure.


## Support open source communities

In addition to 2i2c-specific projects, we also see the health of the open source ecosystem underlying our stack to be a key strategic goal. We have an ongoing "project" to provide support to key communities in this space, and occasionally have more specific projects to work on.
